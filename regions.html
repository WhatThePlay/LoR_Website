                    Risk and Reward <br><br>
                    Across the Guardian's Sea, nestled amongst the Blue Flame Isles, Bilgewater Bay is as lawless as the
                    denizens that call it home. Smugglers and cutthroats lay claim to these shores, making a name for
                    themselves with sharp minds and sharper blades. The land is not the only perilous place, for danger
                    lurks beneath the waves. Are you prepared to risk it all for the ultimate prize?

                    Justice. Honor. Duty. Proud Demacia sits on the northwestern edge of Runeterra. Once a safe haven
                    from a brutal war, Demacia is now caught between the shifting tides of time. Can this mighty kingdom
                    evolve to further serve its people, or do they face obsoletion along the march of progress? Stand on
                    the side of justice!

                    In the bitter cold of the frozen north known as the Freljord, the wilderness is torn asunder from a
                    savage, three-way civil war. Those who call this place home must find the fire within to persevere
                    through harsh conditions and stand as paragons of fortitude and resilience. Can you weather the path
                    to victory?

                    Swift and Sure <br><br>
                    Balance: the cornerstone of the First Lands we know as Ionia. Once, it existed aplenty, with the
                    spiritual and physical worlds coexisting together in harmony...but such serenity is fleeting. Noxus,
                    bent on imperial expansion, brought their insatiable hunger to Ionia's shores. Though the empire was
                    driven out, there is an air of uncertainty hovering over the land. Are you willing to pay the price
                    for peace?

                    The champions of Targon gaze toward the heavens for answers, and sometimes the heavens gaze back. By
                    the glory of day or the strength of night, all may shoot for the stars. Are you ready to conquer the
                    summit?

                    A brutal, expansionist empire where might makes right, Noxus sprawls across the continent in a
                    struggle for complete dominance. However, within the region's borders beats a heart fueled by the
                    blood, sweat, and tears of its dedicated citizens, allowing any who would try for power to step
                    forth and seize victory...if they're able. Do you have what it takes?

                    Machinations and Mayhem <br><br>
                    Piltover and Zaun may seem worlds apart, but an unusual harmony connects them beyond mere proximity.
                    On the surface, Piltover is a prosperous city of industry. Standing as Valoran's cultural center,
                    innovation and ingenuity are prized. However, amidst the cliffs beneath Piltover lies Zaun. Swathed
                    in a smog-induced twilight, Zaun thrives in the shadow of its sister city. When the brilliant
                    scientists above find society too constraining, they journey below, into the toxic air to conduct
                    their experiments. Will you choose to stay on the surface or chance what lurks beneath?

                    The Blessed Isles were once a thriving, fertile land...until the king of the Isles, beset by grief,
                    sought to defy the natural order of the world, bringing ruination to the land. Now the Shadow Isles,
                    veiled by the sinister shroud known as the Black Mist, leech life from any creature who dares step
                    foot on those cursed shores. Do you dare turn your gaze to the Shadow Isles?

                    thrive on it. Merciless mercenaries and ascended warriors alike grow strong with the blessings of
                    the sands. Are you ready to summon your own inner strength?
